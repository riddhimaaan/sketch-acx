/**
 * SendFileToChat MCP tool — allows the agent to queue files for upload back to the chat.
 *
 * Uses createSdkMcpServer() which is the SDK's only supported way to add custom tools.
 * It's in-memory only — no network server, just JS function dispatch over the existing
 * stdio pipe. Follows pi-mono's pattern: explicit tool call + injected upload function.
 *
 * UploadCollector is created per agent run. The tool handler validates the file path is
 * within the workspace and collects it. After the run, the caller drains the collector
 * and uploads via the platform-specific adapter (Slack files.uploadV2, etc.).
